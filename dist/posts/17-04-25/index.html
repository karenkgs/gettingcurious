    <h1>17/4/25 - Thoughts today</h1>
    <p>Today is a beautiful day in Sydney, it's the Easter Holiday and a lot of people are out.</p>
    <p>Parks are full of people getting active and enjoying nature.</p>
    <p>I'm wondering how to create a blog to share useful tips and tutorials.</p>
    <p>I started with a static website and want to make the blog styled and easily share the same page style and headers
      amongst all blog posts.</p>
    <p>Here's my TODO list:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide how the design will look like and what are the shared/fixed elements.</li>
      <li>Create shared/fixed elements.</li>
      <li>Decide on a strategy to always present the shared/fixed elements.</li>
      <li>Apply the design and implement the strategy.</li>
      <li>Write about the process and learnings.</li>
      <li>When I have more than one blog post, decide how to write them without having to always create a new .html file
        and elements myself.</li>
      <li>Implement the strategy.</li>
    </ol>
